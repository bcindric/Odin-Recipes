    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>227g tub clotted cream</li>
      <li>25g butter (about 2 tbsp)</li>
      <li>1 tsp cornflour</li>
      <li>100g parmesan, grated</li>
      <li>freshly grated nutmag</li>
      <li>250g fresh fettuccine or tagliatelle</li>
      <li>snipped chives or chopped parsley, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong
          >In a medium saucepan, stir the clotted cream, butter and cornflour
          over a low-ish heat and bring to a low simmer. Turn off the heat and
          keep warm.

          >Meanwhile, put the cheese and nutmeg in a small bowl and add a good
          grinding of black pepper, then stir everything together (don't add any
          salt at this stage).
        </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Put the pasta in another pan with 2 tsp salt, pour over some boiling
          water and cook following pack instructions (usually 3-4mins). When
          cooked, scoop some of the cooking water into a heatproof jug or mug
          and drain the pasta, but not too thoroughly.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Add the pasta to the pan with the clotted cream mixture, then
          sprinkle over the cheese and gently fold everything together over a
          low heat using a rubber spatula. When combined, splash in 3 tbsp of
          the cooking water. At first, the pasta will look wet and sloppy: keep
          stirring until the water is absorbed and the sauce is glossy. Check
          the seasoning before transferring to heated bowls. Sprinkle over some
          chives or parsley, then serve immediately.
